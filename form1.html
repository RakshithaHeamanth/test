 <p><i><h2>WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK BASED SMART HOME MONITORING SYSTEM USING LoRa</i></p></h2>
<p><i>"The aim is to design and develop a wireless sensor network infrastructure for a smart home using the Internet of Things which can be used to monitor different devices and to update the user with real-time data.

It enables remote monitoring of conditions inside the home and creates an alert when any one of the values goes beyond the threshold value, and that is detected by unique buzzer sound, the sensor data are constantly monitored for each sensor node which are connected together by Lora Wireless module capable of long range transmission, It handles and supports low power consumption and multiple environment monitoring sensors.
